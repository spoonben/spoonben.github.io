# spoonben.github.io

A copy of my website from [http://benspoon.com](benspoon.com). 

There is a bunch of junk in here that doesn' need to be here. 

I really need to update this, or do something with it, or.. something.

Not seeing my icons? That is because I was lazy, and used Font Awesome. I am working
on changing that. Until then, unblock the page in your adblocker.
